# Motion-Planner
This project is a motion planner for a differential drive robot made in MATLAB. The RRT Algorithm is implemented and improved to provide the robot with a more optimal path. The environment contains a start point, end point, and obstacles for the robot to avoid.

## Quick Start Guide

The files contained in this repository include occupancy grid maps, main algorithms, and a project report.
